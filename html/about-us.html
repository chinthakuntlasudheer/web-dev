        <p>Your parents were right: school really is important (and so is wearing clean socks). It’s so important, in fact, that quality education for all is one of the world’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, because education is one of the most powerful and proven ways to break the cycle of poverty for kids and their countries. But “school” can mean very different things in different parts of the world – and the standard of education that kids in different countries receive can be wildly different as a result.</p>
